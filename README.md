# artifact-js
## What is it?
The happy end of the a long tale how to retrieve a dream artifact.

## How it can be useful for me?
If you need to retrieve an artifact from the artifactory by by JavaScript? 
Much.

## How it works?
If you have a pro version of the artifactory, you can retrieve artifacts by REST. 
If not, you can use Maven metadata to get information about the latest version and with a little bit of work, you can get the the same result.

## How to configure?
I like simple things. All what you need to configure you can find in `config.json`.

##How to run?
You can run the script from the command line:

> node ./src/artifact

## What next?
If you have a problem, write me.
